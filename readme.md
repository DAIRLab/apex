This is a small pytorch library that contains some implementations of
reinforcement learning algorithms. I use this for learning and for my research
which centers around continuous domains, which is why these algorithms do not
have discrete implementations, though it'd be trivial to change them.

Soon to be implemented:

* PPO
* A3C
* Parallelism

To be implemented long term:

* DDPG
* SVG
* Noisy Nets for Exploration

Maybe implemented in future:

* TRPO
* DXNN
* ACER and other off-policy methods
* Model-based methods
